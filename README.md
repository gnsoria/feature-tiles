# Feature Tiles

A simple set of React components for creating tiles to show off site features.

## How to use it

It doesn't have any dependencies, so the easiest way is to just git submodule it into your project:

```
git submodule add [github-ssh-link] /path/to/submodule/
```

At some point I'll package it up, but at the moment I'm just splitting it into a new repo so that I can use it across projects.
